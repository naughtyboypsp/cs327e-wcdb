		<HumanImpact>
			Two workers died from the explosions on the day of the accident. 
			Twenty eight more workers died by the end of July as a result of acute 
			radiation poisoning. Another 106 workers received enough radiation to cause 
			acute radiation sickness. About 115,000 people who lived within a 30 
			kilometer radius of the site were evacuated within a month of the accident. 
			220,000 more people were evacuated in subsequent years. Currently, there is 
			no scientific evidence that the radiation from the accident greatly 
			increased cases of leukemia or solid cancer, other than thyroid cancer, 
			which can be easily treated. However, the cleanup workers who were exposed 
			are still at risk for cancer in the long term. 	
		</HumanImpact>
		<EconomicImpact>
			Local agriculture was hit hard, with 784,320 hectares put out of service. 
			694,200 hectares of forest were halted from timber production. Precise 
			financial expenditures have been immense and impossible to calculate. 
			Costs include direct damage, recover and mitigation, resettlement, social 
			protection and health care, environmental research, and many others. The 
			country of Belarus has estimated a total cost of $235 billion. The accident 
			still drains the budget of Belarus and Ukraine even to this day.

			The group was founded in 1985 by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
			as an advisory committee in the area of nuclear safety. It consists of about 
			17 safety experts who work in regulatory organizations, research and academic 
			institutions, and the nuclear industry. Over the years, INSAG has produced 
			23 reports with results of various studies, which have greatly advanced 
			nuclear safety. One of its first investigations was the Chernobyl accident.
